### **How to Navigate**

1. **Data Structure Folders**: Each major data structure (like Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.) has its own folder under . Inside each folder, there are 3 subfolders for **C++**, **Go**, and **JavaScript**.
2. **Difficulty Levels**: Each language folder (e.g., , , ) is divided into three subfolders based on difficulty:
   - **basic**: Simple problems to get started.
   - **medium**: Moderate complexity problems.
   - **hard**: Advanced problems for deeper understanding and skill-building.
3. **Problem Files**: Each problem is contained in a single file (e.g., , , ), containing the solution for that problem in the respective language.

### **How to Use This Repo**
